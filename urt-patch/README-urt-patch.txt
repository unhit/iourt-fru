This directory contains one patch file, ioUrT-4.1-server-r1240-ioquake3.patch.
This file contains the diff going from ioquake3 revision 1240 to the released
ioUrT 4.1 server source code in the ioUrbanTerrorSource_2007_12_20.zip bundle.
This patch is here as a reference so people could see what changes were
made to the ioquake3 source code in order to create the ioUrTded binary.
You should _not_ apply this patch because it is already applied [obviously].
