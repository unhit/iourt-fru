    <a name="overview"></a>
    <h2>Section 1: Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This is open source software for running a simple UDP server that provides geolocations for IP addresses.
      A request packet incoming to the server will contain an IP address, and the response packet outgoing from
      the server will contain a country code, country name, region, city, latitude, and longitude for the IP address.
    </p>
    <p>
      This software is distributed under a BSD-style license.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are some selling points of this software:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Compiles and runs on UNIX systems (FreeBSD, Linux, and MacOSX have been tested).</li>
      <li>It is extremely simple in design.  It runs on the command-line, in the foreground (no forking).
        A single configuration file is needed for setting a password.  There are no external software dependencies
        (no database server required).</li>
      <li>The algorithm used to look up locations is extremely efficient and probably cannot be optimized any
        further.  The server has been tested to successfully serve well over 100,000 requests per second.</li>
      <li>Utilizes 2 cores of a CPU.  One thread reads incoming packets and does some minimal processing, throwing
        away packets that are not valid.
        A second thread parses valid packets, does lookups, and sends responses.</li>
      <li>Because of the dual-threaded design, the server is not easily vulnerable to packet flood attacks.</li>
      <li>Uses almost 0% CPU when idle.</li>
      <li>Consumes a constant amount of memory: about 25 megabytes of RAM.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Drawbacks of using this software:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>UDP is an unreliable protocol.  Packets may be lost on the network with no error reporting.  Other
        network-related problems may surface.
      </li>
      <li>
        The server uses proprietary IP-to-location data that is sold by IP2Location(TM).  You need to
        acquire a copy of this data via [hopefully] legal means.  See <a href="#database">Section 3</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The ip2loc server does not run on Windows, but who cares, right?
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please refer to the <a href="#protocol">protocol</a> for an explanation of the functionality that this server
      has to offer.</p>
    <hr /><br />
    <a name="software"></a>
    <h2>Section 2: Getting the Software</h2>
    <p>To get the source code and documentation for the ip2loc server:</p>
    <blockquote><pre width="80" style="background: #CCCCCC; padding: 2mm; border-style: ridge">rambetter@porky% <b>svn checkout svn://svn.clanwtf.net/repos/ip2loc ./ip2loc</b>
</pre></blockquote>
    <p>The most recent version of this HTML document that you are now reading is available as
      <code>./ip2loc/README.html</code> .
    </p>
    <p>Once you have the source code downloaded, the next step is to compile:</p>
    <blockquote><pre width="80" style="background: #CCCCCC; padding: 2mm; border-style: ridge">rambetter@porky% <b>cd ./ip2loc/server/</b>
rambetter@porky% <b>make</b>
</pre></blockquote>
    <p>This will generate two executables, <code>ip2loc-server</code> and <code>ip2loc-csv-parser</code> .  You
      will need both of these programs.
    </p>
    <hr /><br />
    <a name="database"></a>
    <h2>Section 3: Compiling the IP2Location(TM) Database</h2>
    <p>
      To run the ip2loc server, you need to get your hands on some proprietary data that is provided by
      the company IP2Location(TM).  The exact product that you need from them is DB5
      (<a href="http://www.ip2location.com/ip-country-region-city-latitude-longitude.aspx">link here</a>).
    </p>
    <p>DB5 is downloaded as a ZIP archive named <code>IP-COUNTRY-REGION-CITY-LATITUDE-LONGITUDE-FULL.ZIP</code> .
      Inside this archive is a file named <code>IP-COUNTRY-REGION-CITY-LATITUDE-LONGITUDE.CSV</code> .  This
      CSV file is the only file that we need.  Uncompressed, the CSV file is approximately 250 megabytes in size.
      Fortunately, it is a file consisting of plain text, and it compresses pretty well (the ZIP file distributable
      is just under 40 megabytes in size).
    </p>
    <p>The IP2Location(TM) proprietary IP-to-location data is updated once a month, at the beginning of each month.
      Usually, you buy a one-year subscription to DB5 for about $350, then download the updated data at the beginning
      of each month from IP2Location(TM).
    </p>
    <p>Note that it is possible to find this IP2Location(TM) DB5 product using torrents.  However, acquiring the
      proprietary data in this fashion is not lawful and such activity is not endorsed by the author.
    </p>
    <p>We now need to "compile" the <code>IP-COUNTRY-REGION-CITY-LATITUDE-LONGITUDE.CSV</code> file into a much more
      compact custom format that is needed to run the ip2loc server.  To do this, we use the
      <code>ip2loc-csv-parser</code> command.  This command is very simple: it takes no command-line arguments,
      reads the CSV file from standard input, and writes a compiled version of the database to standard output.
      Any parsing errors are displayed on standard error.  Usually, you'll want to save the compiled
      IP-to-location database to a file named <code>ip2loc.bin</code> .  To sum up, we run a command such as this:
    </p>
    <blockquote><pre width="102" style="background: #CCCCCC; padding: 2mm; border-style: ridge">rambetter@porky% <b>cat IP-COUNTRY-REGION-CITY-LATITUDE-LONGITUDE.CSV | ./ip2loc-csv-parser > ip2loc.bin</b>
</pre></blockquote>
    <p>The generated <code>ip2loc.bin</code> file will be about 20 megabytes in size.  You will need this file to
      run the ip2loc server, so keep it handy.  The <code>ip2loc.bin</code> file compresses to about 10 megabytes using
      standard compression tools such as <code>gzip</code> .  You may consider storing it compressed if disk usage is
      an issue, in which case you'll want to <code>gunzip</code> the file on-the-fly when you need to use it later on.
    </p>
    <hr /><br />
    <a name="launching"></a>
    <h2>Section 4: Launching the Server Process</h2>
    <p>The executable to launch the server process is <code>ip2loc-server</code> .  You can run
      this binary with no arguments to get a better idea of how to use it:
    </p>
    <blockquote><pre width="80" style="background: #CCCCCC; padding: 2mm; border-style: ridge">rambetter@porky% <b>./ip2loc-server</b>
Usage:
  ./ip2loc-server &lt;listen-port&gt; &lt;listen-IP&gt;
The second argument, the IP address to listen on, can be omitted, in which
case the server will listen on all available interfaces.  This program reads
standard input, which should be the contents of an "ip2loc.bin" file.  A
file in the current directory named ".password" will be read, which should
consist of a single line of text specifying the password that the server will
be protected by.
</pre></blockquote>
    <p>The server actually only listens on IPv4 addresses.  Listening on IPv6 interfaces is not yet supported.
      So, to run the server, we'll do something like this:</p>
    <blockquote><pre width="80" style="background: #CCCCCC; padding: 2mm; border-style: ridge">rambetter@porky% <b>echo "pa55w0rd" > .password</b>
rambetter@porky% <b>cat ip2loc.bin | ./ip2loc-server 10020 127.0.0.1</b>
</pre></blockquote>
    <p>Note that the server process runs in the foreground.  If you want to launch the server in your shell and
      then leave the server running after logging out of your shell,
      you'll need to either use a tool such as <code>screen</code>
      or use a utility such as <code>/usr/sbin/daemon</code> on FreeBSD to launch the server process.  Also, you
      probably want to pipe standard error to a log file.  Nothing on standard out will be generated by the server
      program.
    </p>
    <hr /><br />
    <a name="protocol"></a>
    <h2>Section 5: Protocol Reference</h2>
    <p>This section describes the communication over network UDP that happens with the ip2loc server.</p>
    <p>The country code, country, region, and city strings will always consist of ASCII text (punctuation characters such as commas
      may be present).  These strings will never contain the double quote character '&quot;' or the newline character '\n'.  Also,
      no lowercase letters ('a' through 'z') will be present in the strings.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>getLocationForIP</h3>
    <p>A request to the ip2loc server looks like this (over UDP):</p>
    <blockquote><pre width="80" style="background: #FFCCCC; padding: 2mm; border-style: ridge">ip2locRequest
pa55w0rd
getLocationForIP:0e7baf16
64.156.193.115
</pre></blockquote>
    <p>The lines of text in the request are separated by a single newline character.  There must be a trailing newline
      after the packet.  The second line must match the contents of the <code>.password</code> file exactly, and the last
      line is the IP address to be queried.</p>
    <p>In the example above, the third line contains what is called a challenge field.  This is the colon followed by the
      string "0e7baf16".  Including a challenge in the request is optional; that is, the colon and everything coming after it
      can be omitted from the request.  If the challenge is included, it must be a string consisting of exactly 8 characters,
      and each character must be between a digit or a lowercase letter between 'a' and 'f'.  In essence, the challenge
      is a 32 bit field represented in hexadecimal format.  If the challenge is included in the request, it will be
      echoed back in the response.  The purpose of the challenge is to ensure that a response really came from the server
      and was not just a spoofed packet coming from some random location on the internet.
    </p>
    <p>A response looks like this:</p>
    <blockquote><pre width="80" style="background: #CCFFCC; padding: 2mm; border-style: ridge">ip2locResponse
getLocationForIP:0e7baf16
64.156.193.115

US
UNITED STATES
CALIFORNIA
SAN DIEGO
32.7473
-117.148
</pre></blockquote>
    <p>Here, "US" is the country code, "UNITED STATES" is the country, "CALIFORNIA" is the region, and "SAN DIEGO" is the city.
      The second to last line is the latitude and the last line is the longitude.  It may happen that some of the values for
      country code, country, region, and city will not be present.  If that is the case, they will appear as blank lines.  The lines
      of the response packet are separated by a single newline character.
      The last line is terminated by a newline character.</p>
    <p>Because our sample request contained a challenge, the response has a challenge also.  This is the string "0e7baf16" after the
      colon on the second line of the response.  The challenge in the response will equal to the challenge in the request.  If no challenge
      was present in the request, no challenge field will appear in the response (the ':' character plus everything after it will be missing).
    </p>
    <p>If the password is incorrect or if the request packet is malformed in some other way, the server will
      silently drop the packet without sending a response of any kind.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>getLocationForIP (Quake III version)</h3>
    <p>A request to the ip2loc server looks like this (over UDP):</p>
    <blockquote><pre width="80" style="background: #FFCCCC; padding: 2mm; border-style: ridge"><del><b>@@@@</b></del>ip2locRequest
pa55w0rd
getLocationForIP:499a02ec
64.156.193.115
</pre></blockquote>
    <p><code><del><b>@@@@</b></del></code> is the 4 byte quantity consisting of all 1 bits (0xffffffff).
    </p>
    <p>If the request is well-formed and if the password is correct, the server will respond with a UDP packet
      that looks like this:</p>
    <blockquote><pre width="131" style="background: #CCFFCC; padding: 2mm; border-style: ridge"><del><b>@@@@</b></del>ip2LocResponse "getLocationForIP:499a02ec" "64.156.193.115" "US" "UNITED STATES" "CALIFORNIA" "SAN DIEGO" "32.7473" "-117.148"
</pre></blockquote>
    <p>The response does <i>not</i> have a trailing newline.  The challenge field is optional (see example above).</p>
    <br />
    <h3>quit</h3>
    <p>You can shut down the ip2loc server process by sending a "quit" request.  However, this request must be
      sent from the loopback (127.0.0.1) address.  If the ip2loc server is not listening on the loopback interface,
      the packet must be sent from the same IP address that the server process is listening on.</p>
    <blockquote><pre width="80" style="background: #FFCCCC; padding: 2mm; border-style: ridge">ip2locRequest
pa55w0rd
quit
</pre></blockquote>
    <p>No response is returned for this type of packet.  A challenge field may be present after the "quit" command, but it serves no purpose.</p>
    <hr /><br />
    <a name="php-client"></a>
    <h2>Section 6: PHP Client</h2>
    <p>A PHP client library is available for communicating with the ip2loc server.  After you check out the ip2loc source code from SVN as described
      in <a href="#software">Section 2</a>, the PHP client library will be located in file <tt>./ip2loc/client/php/ip2loc.php</tt> .
      There are some PHP test scripts that demonstrate usage of the PHP client library in the same directory as <tt>ip2loc.php</tt> .
      A bare minimum PHP example without any error checking would look like this:
    </p>
    <blockquote><pre width="80" style="background: #EEEEEE; padding: 2mm; border-style: ridge"><span class="preprocessor">&lt;?php</span>

<span class="keyword">require_once</span> <span class="string">"ip2loc.php"</span>;

$<span class="variable-name">ip</span> = <span class="string">"99.50.206.241"</span>; 
$<span class="variable-name">ip2loc</span> = <span class="keyword">new</span> <span class="type">ip2loc</span>(<span class="string">"pa55w0rd"</span>, <span class="string">"localhost"</span>, <span class="default">10020</span>);
$<span class="variable-name">locations</span> = $<span class="variable-name">ip2loc</span>-&gt;<span class="default">get_locations</span>(<span class="default">array(</span>$<span class="variable-name">ip</span>));
$<span class="variable-name">ip2loc</span>-&gt;<span class="default">close</span>();
<span class="keyword">echo</span> $<span class="variable-name">ip</span> . <span class="string">" is from "</span> . $<span class="variable-name">locations</span>[$<span class="variable-name">ip</span>]-&gt;<span class="default">country</span>() . <span class="string">"\n"</span>;

<span class="preprocessor">?&gt;</span>
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In practice, however, you would want to write slightly more code to perform some error checking.
      Let's take an example.  Suppose you are running forums software such as phpBB or Simple Machines Forum (SMF).
      Suppose you've been getting lots of spam from Russia and China.  You would like to block any activity
      from these two countries to any part of your website.  First, create a file named <tt>ip2loc-connect-info.php</tt>
      and put that into one of your PHP includes directories.  (I like to keep this sensitive information in a location
      away from the webroot for security reasons.)  The contents of <tt>ip2loc-connect-info.php</tt> will be the
      following:
    </p>
    <blockquote><pre width="80" style="background: #EEEEEE; padding: 2mm; border-style: ridge"><span class="preprocessor">&lt;?php</span>

<span class="default">define(</span><span class="string">"IP2LOC_SERV_PASSWORD"</span>, <span class="string">"pa55w0rd"</span>);
<span class="default">define(</span><span class="string">"IP2LOC_SERV_ADDRESS"</span>, <span class="string">"localhost"</span>);
<span class="default">define(</span><span class="string">"IP2LOC_SERV_PORT"</span>, <span class="default">10020</span>);
<span class="default">define(</span><span class="string">"IP2LOC_TIMEOUT"</span>, <span class="default">200</span>);
<span class="default">define(</span><span class="string">"IP2LOC_RETRIES"</span>, <span class="default">1</span>);

<span class="preprocessor">?&gt;</span>
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Then, you should find a file that is included at the start of every webpage that a user can hit on your website.
      In the case of phpBB, such a file is <tt>common.php</tt> in webroot.  In the case of SMF 1.1.x, such a file is
      <tt>index.php</tt> in webroot.  At the very top of such a file, you can add PHP code such as the following.
      Bear in mind that this code should be executed before any data is written to the client because the function
      <tt>header()</tt> writes an HTTP header to the client, and a header can't be changed once data in the body of
      the HTTP response is written.

    <p>
